# The authentication app is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization
# within the Podcast Marketing Automation SaaS platform.

# If any app-specific initialization is required for the authentication app,
# it should be added here. Currently, no initialization is needed.

# Note: Custom user model or authentication backends are typically specified
# in the Django settings file (settings.py) rather than here.

# Human tasks:
# TODO: Decide if any app-specific initialization is required for the authentication app
# TODO: Determine if custom user model or authentication backends need to be specified here
