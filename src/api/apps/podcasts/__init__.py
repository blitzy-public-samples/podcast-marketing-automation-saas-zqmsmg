# It may be used to perform any necessary setup when the app is loaded.

# Currently, this file is empty as no specific initialization is required for the podcasts app.
# However, it serves as a marker to indicate that this directory should be treated as a Python package.

# If any app-specific initialization is needed in the future, it can be added here.

# For example, if using Django signals, you might consider adding them here or in a separate signals.py file:
# from django.apps import AppConfig
#
# class PodcastsConfig(AppConfig):
#     default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
#     name = 'api.apps.podcasts'
#
#     def ready(self):
#         import api.apps.podcasts.signals

# Human Tasks:
# 1. Decide if any app-specific initialization is required for the podcasts app
# 2. If using Django signals, consider adding them here or in a separate signals.py file
