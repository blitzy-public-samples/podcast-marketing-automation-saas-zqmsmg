# It allows the applications within this directory to be imported elsewhere in the project.

# The presence of this file enables Django to recognize the 'apps' directory
# as a package, facilitating the organization of the project into smaller,
# reusable applications.

# Each subdirectory within 'apps' typically represents a distinct Django application,
# each with its own models, views, and other related files.

# By structuring the project this way, we promote modularity and separation of concerns,
# making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
