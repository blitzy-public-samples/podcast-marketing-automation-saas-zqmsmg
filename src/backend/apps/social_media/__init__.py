# This file is intentionally left empty to make the social_media app a Python package.
# It allows the app to be imported and used in other parts of the project.

# If needed in the future, you can add any necessary imports or initialization code here.
# For example:
# from .models import SocialMediaPost
# from .views import SocialMediaPostViewSet

# Human tasks:
# - Decide if any models, views, or utilities from the social_media app need to be imported here for convenience.
