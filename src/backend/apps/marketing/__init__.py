# The marketing app is responsible for handling marketing-related functionalities
# in the Podcast Marketing Automation SaaS platform.

# Potential future initialization tasks:
# 1. Import and configure app-specific settings
# 2. Initialize any required marketing services or integrations
# 3. Set up signal handlers for marketing-related events

# Note: As of now, no specific initialization is required for the marketing app.
# If needed in the future, add the necessary code here.
