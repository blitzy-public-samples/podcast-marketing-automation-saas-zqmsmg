# It allows Python to recognize the 'apps' directory as a package and enables
# importing modules from this directory.

# In the context of Django, this file can be used to perform any necessary
# package-level initialization for the 'apps' package, although in this case,
# no specific initialization is required.

# The presence of this file allows other parts of the project to import
# modules from the 'apps' package using statements like:
# from apps.authentication import views as auth_views
# from apps.podcasts import models as podcast_models

# If any common functionality or configuration needs to be shared across
# multiple apps in the future, it can be added here.
