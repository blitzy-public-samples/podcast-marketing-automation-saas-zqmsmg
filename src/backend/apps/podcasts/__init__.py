# It allows Python to import the podcasts app and its modules.

# If any app-specific initialization is required in the future, it can be added here.
# For example, you might want to set up app configurations or import signals.

# from django.apps import AppConfig

# class PodcastsConfig(AppConfig):
#     default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
#     name = 'apps.podcasts'

#     def ready(self):
#         import apps.podcasts.signals
