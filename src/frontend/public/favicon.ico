Key points about this file:
1. It should be a small, recognizable icon representing the platform's brand.
2. Typical dimensions include 16x16 pixels, 32x32 pixels, or multiple sizes in the same file.
3. Keep the file size small for fast loading (ideally under 10KB).
4. The icon should be simple and scalable, recognizable even at small sizes.
5. Consider including multiple sizes in the ICO file for better display across different contexts.

To create this file:
1. Design a simple, recognizable logo for the Podcast Marketing Automation SaaS platform.
2. Create versions of the logo at 16x16, 32x32, and optionally 48x48 pixels.
3. Use an ICO file creator tool or image editing software that supports ICO format.
4. Save the file as 'favicon.ico' in the 'src/frontend/public/' directory.

This file will be automatically detected by most browsers when placed in the public directory.
For explicit reference, include the following line in the <head> section of your HTML:
<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />

Remember to optimize the favicon for various sizes and contexts to ensure it looks good
across different devices and browser implementations.

Human tasks:
1. Design and create a favicon that represents the Podcast Marketing Automation SaaS platform's brand (Required)
2. Optimize the favicon for various sizes and contexts (Optional)

Once the favicon is created, replace this comment with the actual ICO file.
